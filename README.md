I set out to create a text-based adventure game for this project.

This game should utilize the following Python essentials:
- Strings and String Manipulation
- User-Defined Functions and Objects (variables)
- User Input and Input Handling
- Conditional and Nested Conditional Statements (if/elif/else)
- Loops (for/while)
- Controlling for Errors

I have selected a classic case of Monty Hall Problem and made changes across the challenges. Have fun solving the problem!
